<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I have been inspired by the portfolio sites of peers and mentors and often wished I had my own, so when the time came to choose a capstone project for Foundations at [Holberton School](www.holbertonschool.com) I transformed that wish into a goal with a timeline. This website is the product.

I was well on my way to a static HTML website when I took a detour and tried my hand at a React blog engine. It was my first time with React and I was shocked by how approachable I found it. I kept working on my HTML, but I couldn't let it go. It felt wrong to tack the blog engine onto what I was building, so eventually I scrapped it all and started over, this time with Next.js/React from the start.

Because I chose a personal project, I worked solo. I utilized tutorials, countless 'googles', forums, Twitter, and the good old docs to solve problems as I came up against them. I encountered many issues that required I make executive decisions in order to meet my deadline. I am extremely pleased with the result and still have work to do– that's a splendid feeling.

Read more in my blog post, [The Making of This Site](https://www.tabitha.tech/writings/making-of-this-website).

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Feel free to fork/clone/snag whatever you like from this project for your own use. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

After forking the project run:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

Please remove any references to my name & my writing, and have at it.

### Deployment

I deploy with Vercel from the main branch of this repository. Want to see it in action? Here you go:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fhello-world)

<!-- USING EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Using the Blog Engine

Blog entries are created when an appropriate `.md` file is added to the `writings/` or the `portfolio/` directories. The front matter of the post is illustrated in my current writings, but can be altered as you see fit. You can preview the entries at localhost when you `npm run dev`.

Most Markdown style works in this setting, keeping in mind that you can reference items in the `public/` directory like this:

`/item.jpg`

No need for a relative path.

_For more examples, please refer to my blog post on the subject [How to Use Markdown With This Blog Engine](https://www.tabitha.tech/writings/how-to-use-markdown-with-this-blog-engine)_.
