# Inspiration

<p>If you, like me, are new to programming with an interest in front-end
development, I cannot recommend the twitter dev community strongly enough. I
started my first round of <a href ="https://www.100daysofcode.com">#100DaysOfCode</a> and found my people. It
is through this community that I fell in love with Javascript, for better or
worse. It's rare to find a group online that lifts up more than it knocks down,
	but this is one.

# Holberton Portfolio Project #

<p>I'm finishing my Foundations year at Holberton School. This means I am
building my capstone project, which I proposed as a portfolio/personal website
(this one). I wanted to make something solid that I could build on for the next
year. I started this project in plain HTML/CSS/js, but quickly realized that if
I want to build the stretch features I should use React & Next from the start. I have broken this thing more often than not, but that is how I learn best.</p>
<p>As I write this, I have two pages left to build: /portfolio & /resume. While
I originally envisioned my portfolio as a CSS-heavy page, I've decided to keep
it simple and list projects as I have these blog entries. This is the first
major project I have completed on my own (without Holberton guidance) and I
feel power-drunk and frightened at the same time.</p>

# What will I write about?

<p>I've written blogs since they first came about, mostly about day-to-day
life, parenting, and homeschooling (when my kids were young).Today I write
technical blogs for school and pleasure, extoll the virtues of good books or websites, and share the joys & trials of my life as a single mother of 5, fulltime student, and tech newb. </p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy reading here, and if you'd like to respond or discuss you
can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tabby__katz)</p>
