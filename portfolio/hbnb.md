# Attack of the Clone
The AirBnB project arc began with teams writing our own codebase to create a
console with which to interact with our file storage system. By the end, we had
switched teams and codebases 4 times as well as developed features solo which we deployed
on our own set of servers complete with load-balancing, monitoring, and SSL
certificates. I learned to configure a Master-Replica database between servers,
	write puppet manifests to bring new servers up to specification, and deploy
	with gunicorn.

# The complete package

   - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
   - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
   - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
   - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
