_You might think Free Code Camp is lightweight or just another of many free
learn-to-code resources, but it's my favorite platform for front-end practice._


# Free Code Camp is Simple
I have tried many coding platforms, from Coursera to LeetCode, and I absolutely
love the simplicity of FCC's interface. The lessons are short and clear,
	submissions are a cinch, and even more involved projects are a breeze to
	turn in from https://codepen.io/. It's accesible to complete beginners yet
	sturdy enough for more experienced programmers to use for review.

# Free Code Camp is Extensive
Extensive, not exhaustive (what is?). I have made it my goal to complete every
single certification, though recently my focus has been on end-of-trimester
projects. I have picked up a lot of knowledge while also discovering areas I
need to strengthen further, and I am proud of my progress
through the curriculum.
