_We were charged to interpret Monty-like scripted files according to operation codes provided to us in the project._


# What is Monty?
This was one of my first questions when presented with this project, but I
	rapidly realized that the answer was unimportant. Given a rough explanation
	of the opcodes available, we had to create an interpreter, and we did. I
	came away from the project empowered to interpret anything I could get my
	hands on, which made this an excellent stepping stone project.

# If You Must Know
Monty is a "fake" language created just for the purpose of challenging
	students. You can read more at http://montyscoconut.github.io/.
