_We were charged to interpret Monty-scripted files according to operation codes provided to us in the project._

# What is Monty?

This was one of my first questions when presented with this project. My typical pattern when faced with new territory - to Google it - was useless. It took some time and coaxing from mentors for me to accept that the answer was unimportant. Given a rough explanation of the opcodes available, my partner and I had to create an interpreter that passed the testing suite, and we did. I came away from the project empowered to interpret anything I could get my hands on, which made this an excellent stepping stone project.

# I'm especially proud of:

- The growth in understanding stacks and queues during this project. The opcodes were essentially operations on a buffer of eventual output in the interpreted file.
- Letting go of the why and focusing on the how. This was a test-driven experience, as the checker tests were our main compass.
- Success despite a difficult team experience.

# Problems I encountered:

- A difficult partner who ultimately quit midway. I was able to finish the project for us, but I couldn't help my partner move past his apparent frustration with the lack of project guidelines.
- The lack of documentation. It frustrated me, too. In the end it is what made this such a powerful learning experience.

# If You Must Know
