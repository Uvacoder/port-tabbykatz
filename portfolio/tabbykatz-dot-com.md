_I have wanted a professional website for my portfolio & web
presence for a long time. This project introduced me to React, Next.js, npm, and
Vercel._


Have a look around- you're here! This website was made with React on Next.js and is hosted from github by Vercel.


Features I'm especially proud of:
- Light & Dark Mode Toggle on desktop & mobile.
- Markdown Blog engine
- menu Keyboard Shortcuts. (***Try it-- press the number associated with the menu item on your keyboard***)


This project was my capstone effort for Holberton School, and was originally on my student domain, 'tabitha.tech'. Here's the [landing page](https://www.tabbykatz.com/landing) I made for my instructors at school.


I have gone so much deeper in both Javascript and React since I made this site and it's nearly due for an upgrade, but I am pleased with my first effort.
