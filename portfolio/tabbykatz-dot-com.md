_A professional website for my portfolio & a blog. This project introduced me to React, Next.js, and
Vercel._

Have a look around- you're here! This website was made with React/[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and is continuously deployed from GitHub on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Though it has been updated since I first deployed it in 2020, the core functionality is still the same.

# I'm especially proud of:

- Light & Dark Mode Toggle on desktop & mobile.
- Markdown Blog engine
- menu Keyboard Shortcuts. (**_Try it-- press the number associated with the menu item on your keyboard_**)

This project was my capstone effort for Holberton School, and was originally deployed to my student domain, 'tabitha.tech'.

# Problems I encountered:

- `next.config.js` üò¨ At the time of my first build, no one could tell me how to combine a raw-loader for `.md` files with an `.svg` handler. All of that has been solved with newer releases of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), of course, but it was a huge headache to get the icons working in light & dark mode without breaking my blog engine.
- This was my first time setting up continuous deployment with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). While initially confusing, it has been seamless ever since. The [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) developer support team is amazing. üéâ
- State hooks! So much messy state in this site, something I'd like to clean up in the future, but as my first foray into [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) I am proud of what I was able to do with them. ü™ù
