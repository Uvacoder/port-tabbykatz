_I recently accepted an invitation to train with Techtonica!_

Both the pandemic and closure of Holberton School in California changed the trajectory of my path as a software engineer for better or worse. As I type this California has reopened and everyone I know is vaccinated. Yay! I know I want to jump into the industry strong and capable. What's a girl to do?


I've been busy this year writing and studying, building personal projects, and completing online courses. I've also done a fair amount of reading and know I have grown as an engineer since I left Holberton. I have been looking for my next step and finally found it in the form of Techtonica. 


> We offer six months of free, full-time tech training with living stipends and laptops to Bay Area women and non-binary adults with low incomes, then place graduates into jobs with sponsor companies. -[Techtonica.org](https://techtonica.org/)

# Why Techtonica?

Techtonica has been on my radar for a couple of years, and I found myself uniquely ready for this program this summer because I've decided that whatever I do next as an engineer, I want to help lift up women in tech and beyond. That is built into Techtonicaâ€“ once I complete the internship, I become part of the volunteer community in order to help those who come after me. As I worked my way though the (very intense) application process, I imagined myself on the other side as a mentor, or perhaps even as a staff member at a partner company hiring new Techtonica grads! It was at this point I knew I needed this community in my life. 

# What will I be doing at Techtonica?

I'll be part of a full stack (PERN), project-based cohort with 13 other apprentices. I'm told I will have 'no life', and I am already getting a sense of that during onboarding. I'm excited to learn with a group again! And since I've been writing Javascript for a bit I am not intimidated by that aspect. 

I know plenty of people who "hate Javascript" or otherwise turn their noses up at it, but now that I'm working on my 3rd (or 4th if you count bash) language I don't see what all the fuss is about. So it's a little different- they all are. But fundamentally, they work in about the same way. Maybe it's because I started in C, but I just count myself lucky that I don't have to `malloc()` anything. 


I plan to update the blog much more regularly, but mice and men or something.
