# So much for weekly entries

Hi, I'm still alive. I've been so busy "drinking from the firehose", as they say, that I haven't kept up here. Update time! (btw, if we're just now meeting: I'm a bootcamp-grad software engineer a couple months into my first role on a backend team, working mostly in Rails.)

# I'm <s>still alive</s> thriving

Upstart continues to _wow_ as a place to work. I occasionally check in with others about my standards, i.e. is this awesome or am I just easily impressed? And yeah, sometimes I am easily impressed. But on the whole, I've landed at a great place especially for my first role. The mentorship and inclusivity culture Upstart is known for is more than just talk.

That said, I am in such a constant state of learning that I'm often exhausted after my workday. I've been adding systems of rest into my life to handle this reality, but I still need to find more balance. For me, rest is looking like:

- yoga (new one for me)
- alone time
- a good book
- taking time to laugh with my kids

# Hack*week*? In this economy?

My company stops everything for a week to let the engineers play. No agile rituals, no deployments, no code review. Teams were built and ideas were pitched. I joined a team aiming at building an onboarding curriculum for new hires like myself. I focused on `git`, which was serendipitous because I was already planning a git talk to give to the team. I'm new, it's true, but I'm also learning that I have skills to offer even to the more senior engineers.

Hackweek gave me a chance to contribute in a new way, to meet a bunch of engineers from around the company, and (perhaps most importantly) a chance to step back from my 'regular' work and be better prepared upon return to my normal flow.

How it's going.

The greatest challenge of my new role, by far, has been resisting the urge to stay quiet and take up as little space as possible. I guess this is part of Imposter Syndrome, but it is hard to put myself in growth positions when there is a tiny voice in my head reminding me that I am probably wrong and actually don't even belong here. The feelings of inadequacy are constant. It's easy to say, don't listen to those voices! But I am also working through the ways in which I contribute to these feelings.

- <b>Assigning intentions to others</b>:
  - "They criticized my code, do they hate me?"
  - "They probably think my questions are a waste of their time"
  - "If I leave code review comments and I'm wrong they'll think I'm stupid"
- <b>Asking for help instead of putting my best work out there for others to see and refine</b>:
  - Yeah, asking for help is a good thing, but not if it comes from a place of "There's no way I can figure this out" instead of "I have done all I can alone and now need help." I don't think I am terrible at this one, but it is a habit that leans into Imposter Syndrome and that I definitely want to avoid.
- <b>Trying to be likable when I need to just be effective.</b>
  - Show up, put in the work. That's the most likable thing anyway.

My mentor says all of these things better than I can, but the thing I am trying to focus on is being genuine and assuming everyone else is, too. &hearts;
