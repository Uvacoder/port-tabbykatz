# The Missing Weeks

![Standing desk setup with soft lighting](/standing.jpeg)
I owe myself an apology for not keeping up with my weekly entries here. I was hoping to have them, week by week, to look back upon. But I have been busy these 9 weeks and I will attempt to recall now.

## Week 11

We built 3 full stack apps in one week in React, Node, and Express with PostgreSQL databases. They were a contacts app, a weather app, and a game with a leaderboard. It was a whirlwind week and I flew to Utah at the end of it to visit family. I suppose this was the reason I missed my first entry here, and it feels like a solid reason in retrospect.

## Week 12

We built a blog. Now that I think about it I never merged my work into main. Intense growth this week with regard to React, but I am sure if I look at my code right now it will appear naive even to me.

## Week 13

No code week. This was 'Career Week' with Techtonica. We wrote resumes and cover letters and researched sponsor companies. I had a very hard time writing my first resume, ah sweet summer Tabitha. I have done so many more difficult things since.

## Week 14

Suddenly it was time to prepare for our final projects. I had been unable to think of anything and asked my mentor Kevin to come up with a few options for me, and he did not disappoint. I also gave a presentation to the cohort on Markdown and Github profile READMEs, that was fun!

We made style guides, user flows, and various other design buzzwords for our final projects. At the end of the week we presented our pitch to the cohort and staff. This was, outside of side projects, a second week without writing code.

## Weeks 15 - 18

We had 4 weeks for building our capstone/ final apps. I'll probably write an entire entry about this process for my portfolio, but I am still decompressing from it and haven't had much chance to put it into words. You can see what I built here:

- [Game Night](https://gameknightapp.herokuapp.com/)
- [github repo](https://github.com/tabbykatz/game-night)

Also notable: I started [CSS For Javascript Devs](https://css-for-js.dev/) and I love it.

## Week 19 - The Interviews

That was this past week. Interview week. We'd had mock interviews all along, and probably more than we should have. I am personally grateful that I had enough of them to let go of those things I had been told about technical interviews that ended up being total garbage. After 3 or 4, I stopped preparing at all. The more genuinely conversational I was in interviews, the better the feedback I received. I asked more questions and went into them assuming my interviewer wanted to pair with me on a possibly interesting problem. I had more fun and better outcomes this way.

This week was the 'real deal', though, with the sponsor companies we'd chosen to be candidates for. In my case, I interviewed with [Indeed](https://www.indeed.jobs/), [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/company/careers), [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/careers), and [Freenome](https://careers.freenome.com/). I had an overwhelmingly positive experience. As Techtonica participants, we are able to rate the companies, but their ratings of us come first, as well as the fact that they must find suitable matches for all of us. I will learn Tuesday where I will be working.

## Reading? Never heard of her.

I haven't read from my booklist in 6+ weeks, but I did add a few books. ðŸ˜Š

```js
const bookList = [
  `grokking algorithms`,
  `Domain Driven Design`,
  `Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
  `Attack Surface`,
  `FLOW (re-read)`,
  `A Mind for Numbers`,
  `The Power of Habit`,
  `The Design of Everyday Things`,
];
```
