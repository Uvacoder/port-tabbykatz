# Week 2

Will I become comfortable with this pace I am learning at? Feels impossible. But I am often wrong about these things. I am reading and absorbing more than ever. I want it to be faster. I need more time in the day.

Exciting stuff from this week: Breakthroughs with DOM methods, finding my legs with algorithms in Js but still learning little things (For *of* or for *in*?). Jumped into a Udemy course on vanilla DOM methods that I enjoy. But the highlight was [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/).

If you haven't read it, you're missing something wonderful. And I mean that whether you 'like' Js or not.

## Mentors Rule

K has me thinking about APIs all the time now. I can't help it- there is something about software architecture and design that I am intrigued by. With my recent DOM studies, I am seeing APIs everywhere, but it is not such a hard thing to do.

## Reading

I have too many books going as I mentioned last week. I am so close to done with 3 of them but I haven't been finishing, just starting new ones.

```js
const bookList = [
`Domain Driven Design`,
`The Javascript Way`,
`Polysecure`,
`Javascript: The Good Parts`,
`Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
`The Principals of Object-Oriented Javascript`,
`Crucial Conversations`,
`Goodbye, again (re-read)`,
`Ready Player 2`,
`Attack Surface`,
`FLOW (re-read)`,
`Effective Python`
];
```
