_After a 3 week break, I'm back at the keyboard._

 Had a good break. After graduating from my foundational year as a software engineering student, I turned off my computer. The final weeks of the program were stressful; I de-stressed with gardening, reorganizing around the house, and even a weekened away. I had not seen the Pacific in months, though I live very near to it.

The time off cooincided with Thanksgiving, and I was most excited to focus on this holiday with no deadlines to distract. Covid didn't change plans at all, as we always celebrate with a family meal in our own home. I managed 2 solid weeks without thinking about code, but in the final week it crept into my mind along with worries about the new session. Tomorrow I start week 1 (second week) of Specializations, last week having gone well with a slow review of basic `html`.


Before the break I bought my first Udemy course, and though I was tempted by their post-Thanksgiving sales I still have just the one. The course is [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbyAEcacVlWR3QF/). I should probably get started on that, huh? Though I built this site with React, I want to have a better understanding of the power that I'm aware it is barely harnessing.


We will get into React in the Specializations curriculum later. Overall I am told this year will be less demanding than the last, so I am forming goals for myself to include an hour or two per weekday on extra-curriculars like Udemy. I am glad to be back.
