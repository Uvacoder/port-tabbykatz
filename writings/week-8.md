# Week 8

I haven't been taking very good care of myself and that has to change. In my first weeks at Techtonica I kept a perfect sleep schedule, I obeyed my pomodoro cycle, and I prioritized nutrition and exercise. Much of that fell apart last week, so I have decided to use this long weekend to get it back in order.

## Work

I spent the week making React app after React app, fiddling with different hooks before throwing it all away and starting over. Turns out that while I immediately saw the value of `useReducer()` over `useState()`, I have not yet found an amazing role for `useRef()`. I have so much to learn and I am happy to be moving forward steadily.

I also Played with Jestjs and React Testing Library.

Friday was a postgreSQL-focused day, as a treat.

## Mentors Rule

I found another thing to appreciate about my mentor: he is a witness to my progress. Self educating has its disadvantages and one of them is that I am usually the only witness to my growth. I know myself to be negatively biased judge of myself. My mentor is free of all that. And it is amazing to hear, from someone you trust, that you've come a long way.

## Interesting finds

## Reading

Copying my booklist forward every week sure is humbling. I didn't open a single one of these this week. Instead I read half of Javascript.info (I am keeping a running post of new things I learn while I read [here]("https://www.tabbykatz.com/writings/javascript-dot-info-learning-log")) and all of a book on psql.

And docs. All the docs a girl could want.

```js
const bookList = [
  `grokking algorithms`,
  `Redshirts`,
  `Domain Driven Design`,
  `Polysecure`,
  `Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
  `Crucial Conversations`,
  `Attack Surface`,
  `FLOW (re-read)`,
  `A Mind for Numbers`,
  `So Good They Can't Ignore You`,
];
```
