# Week 5

Is it just me or is there not enough time in the day? I am learning to delay gratification and work on what needs to be done before I jump into passion subjects/ projects. It is hard work. 

## Work

I've been practicing coding along with tutorial videos to increase my understanding, here are some snippets:


little `{ useState }` example in React:
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/silly-onclick-state-4nvx0?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height: 300px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="silly-onclick-state"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

I also had my first genuine data mutation moment in JavaScript! It was fun to finally come up against the dreaded assignment v equality problem. I had to take a screenshot:

## Mentors Rule

I love how working with K exposes me to interesting tools and technologies I might not otherwise have used. This week I've been learning about [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 

## Reading

Argh, my week was short on reading time as I was gearing my kids up for their return to school. I made progress in several of my current reads, though. 

```js
const bookList = [
`grokking algorithms`,
`Redshirts`,
`Domain Driven Design`,
`The Javascript Way`,
`Polysecure`,
`Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
`Crucial Conversations`,
`Attack Surface`,
`FLOW (re-read)`,
];
```
