# Placement and Preparation

After all the work and all the interviews, we were finally informed of our internship placements. The past couple of weeks have been spent wrapping our heads around them, planning for our placements, and (in my case, anyway) resting for the first time in months.

## Upstart

I will begin my software engineering career at [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/careers). I am joining a backend team. I start January 10th and I am excited beyond words. I did it!

## Ruby on Rails

We weren't given much information about the technologies we'd be working with before our placements, but based on my interview I knew I needed to learn Ruby on Rails if I landed at Upstart. As is my way, I jumped in immediately.

I have since slowed my roll, though I am working here and there through the [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). Rest and recovery from an intense 6 months has taken priority, especially after a glimpse into Ruby confirmed what my mentors told me: it's just another programming language. (Hey, hey chill out it's beautiful and unique and sparkley, okay?)

I do want to give a shout out to a new mentor I found through Techtonica, Richie. I knew from early days he was a Rubyist so the very night I received my placement I reached out to him and he did not disappoint. The Ruby community seems grand and I am grateful for his kind welcome. #MINASWAN

## How do we rest?

I've been pushing for 18 months to reach this moment and hardly know how to stop. Of course I want to feel 'ready'- as prepared as possible- for my next step. But I am forcing myself to rest. Reminding myself why I am doing this: for my family, for myself. I can't grind forever. If I want to give this my all (and I do), I need to step back and set myself up for the next step.

For me, that looks like a lot of quiet time. With my kids: just sitting together, talking or reading or cooking. Also by myself: going for long walks on my own and looking for beauty. Recently, I'm also building new habits for the next few months. As intense as these 18 months have been, I anticipate my first role to overwhelm me in the best of ways, and more valuable than Ruby will be a routine that keeps my household running smoothly.
