# Week 4
A blur! My fourth week with Techtonica was also my first week focused on React. It's odd because this site is a React app I built myself, but that is very different from learning React bottom-up. When I made this app I was playing with things I did not always understand. The more I learn, the more little bugs or questions I had then get answered. At some point I'll write a new app to serve as my blog engine, taking advantage of new expertise.

I also started Harvard's CS50 on the side this week. Lecture 0 is certainly compelling, and I stumbled my way through building a little intro project in Scratch (Harder than you'd think!). I have a lot of C, so Lecture 1 involved me looking dubiously at the `<cslib.h>` helper library they give us. I learned C in the very opposite way- they took everything from me and forced me to write it myself. I think they gave me a single function: `puts()`. From there,  everything else was handmade, from `strlen()` to `atoi()` to `printf()`. Eventually, I coauthored a shell in C with my friend Zac. So beginning CS50 with the entire standard lib *and* a helper library feels... wrong.

It's not the end of the world, though. The lectures are wonderful and I truly miss writing in C. I live and breathe JavaScript right now and it's kinda getting to me.

## Work

I want to add a section to these weekly updates where I share screenshots or links to work I've done this week. This is that section.

- [Simple coin flip](https://tabbykatz.github.io/coinFlip/) - [Code on Github](https://github.com/tabbykatz/coinFlip)
- [CS50 Intro (in Scratch)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/558439237/)

## Mentors Rule
One of the highlights of mentorship meetings is getting to peek at K's code. Often it is Java, sometimes Kotlin, and I love looking at it, seeing what I can glean, and feeling excited for all the things I have yet to learn.

This week, I realized I need to break free of my fear of rebasing in git. The way my Techtonica work is reviewed means many branches hanging for a long time, or basically a different workflow than I prefer, resulting in weird merges. I have avoided rebase and similar methods of reorganizing (changing history?) but it's time.

## Reading
I read no paper this week, I was that busy. Not to say I did no reading, far from it. I read much React documentation. Isn't it funny how some documentation is pleasant and helpful (React) and some is not? (Docker)

And so my booklist remains the same as last week:

```js
const bookList = [
`Redshirts`,
`Domain Driven Design`,
`The Javascript Way`,
`Polysecure`,
`Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
`The Principles of Object-Oriented Javascript`,
`Crucial Conversations`,
`Attack Surface`,
`FLOW (re-read)`,
`Effective Python`
];
```
