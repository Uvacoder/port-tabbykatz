_This common tech phrase explained_

![IoT](/iot.png)

Tech buzzwords can be so confusing, whether you're new to tech or not, and I've often wished for an accessible glossary just for the jargon of technology. Today I want to offer you the summary I wish I had when I first heard the phrase Internet of Things (IoT).

>The term "Internet of things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999, though he prefers the phrase "Internet for things". -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

The gist here is that devices and items are connected via the internet. This connectivity comes in the form of embedded systems large and small. Examples include the Amazon Echo and similar, smart appliances and home security, pacemakers and wearable fitness devices, and even farming systems and equipment. There are billions of physical devices around the world that are connected to the internet, all collecting and sharing data in various ways. Chances are you use at least one.


When we say IoT we're usually referring to devices that aren't traditionally expected to have an internet connection. What's more, they can communicate with the network without human intervention. This is why your laptop isn't generally considered an IoT device and neither is your iPhone - even though your phone is connected to the internet and full or embedded systems. A smartwatch or a Fitbit might qualify as an IoT device, however. You can see that the term is loosely defined, but hopefully you get the idea.

# How did we get here?

Conceptually, the idea of adding IoT capabilities has been in the works since the 1980s, but apart from a few examples- such as an internet-connected vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University- IoT remained an idea simply because technology wasn't there yet. Chips were too big and expensive, and we didn't have infrastructure for connected objects to communicate effectively.


Once we developed cheap and small embeds, it became cost-effective to connect the billions of devices we now call IoT.

# How is IoT changing the world for the better?

The IoT industry is more than just fun gadgets and toys. Huge leaps are being made with IoT in the world of healthcare, environmental studies, and civic infrastructure.


In healthcare, it's more than just pacemakers. Healthcare professionals are already using IoT devices to monitor patients, prescribe, and even administer medications.The NHS has been trialing its Test Bed Programme since 2016.


Environmental studies have benefited from connected devices and the data they can collect for us. Scientists are able to gather real-time readings from areas of study such as fields, forests, oceans, and deserts that give them a new understanding of everything from precipitation to pollution. This data is already being used to plan for and prevent disasters including crop failures and flooding. Other connected devices such as drones are able to do more than just collect data, they can act on the data gathered to save both time and human labor. The network of IoT systems is even being used to understand climate change.


In massive cities such as Singapore, entire wireless nets of civic IoT devices help manage the day-to-day struggles of a growing population. Traffic is controlled based on real-time data and elderly residents are able to get help more efficiently. Having the network embedded in every building and funded by the government means that even low-income citizens benefit.

# Why should I care?

First, as a user of intelligent personal assistants myself, I'd say it's important to understand the technology you're inviting into your everyday life. But even if you avoid such things, they are a fact of the world you're living in and knowledge is power. Still, there is (to my mind)an even greater cause for care–and concern.


Security is the first issue that comes to mind with the IoT. The sensors in your life and home are collecting extremely sensitive data - my Echo device listens constantly to every sound made in my home. Keeping this data safe is vital, and IoT has a bad track record of doing so.


>As for IoT, information about a user's daily routine is collected so that the
>"things" around the user can cooperate to provide better services that fulfill
>personal preference. When the collected information which describes a user in
>detail travels through multiple hops in a network, due to a diverse
>integration of services, devices and network, the information stored on a
>device is vulnerable to privacy violation by compromising nodes existing in an
>IoT network. -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Privacy_and_security_concerns)


Flaws in the software controlling and monitoring IoT devices are discovered regularly. Hackers actively target IoT devices, though in this time of big data they might be the least concern. It is naive to think that companies themselves are doing nothing with the data they collect with these devices.

# What is being done about the risks?

As usual, technology is moving faster than law, but there are examples of government response to protect citizens. One such is the The UK government's guidelines around the security of consumer IoT devices. These will require devices to have unique passwords, require companies to provide a gateway for users to report vulnerabilities, and require manufacturers to explicitly state how long devices will be updates and supported (akin to LTS). This is a start, but it has been a relatively long time coming.


While the UK and Australia have led the way with voluntary guidelines, other nations are following suit in one form or another. In January 2020, both California and Oregon (USA) introduced legislation requiring "reasonable security features" to be added to IoT devices. In the case of California:

>The law requires IoT device manufacturers to equip each connected device "with
>a reasonable security feature or features" that are 1) appropriate to the
>nature and function of the device; 2) appropriate to the information the
>device may collect, contain or transmit; and 3) designed to protect both the
>device and any information it contains from unauthorized access, destruction,
	>use, modification, or disclosure. -[Source](https://www.allot.com/blog/new-iot-security-regulations-what-you-need-to-know/#)


# Internet of Things: yea or nay?

I've already admitted to letting the devices listen in on my household, so you know where I stand personally. Life is hard and connected devices can help. There is no denying this. It will soon become almost impossible to escape the IoT industry or prevent your data from being used as past of the panopticon, so why not invite some of it in and enjoy the benefits? But there are problems with this stance. It's the age old "Well, it doesn't harm me personally, so what do I care?" Beyond even the security issues with IoT software and data protection, there are dangers ahead for this seemingly unstoppable train.


Demon-Haunted World, a Locus article by Cory Doctorow, reveals one active danger in the world of IoT: simple cheating designed to make the manufactures more millions.


>You've probably heard stories of inkjet cartridges that under-report their
>fill-levels, demanding that you throw them away and replace them while there's

>these forms of cheating treat the owner of the device as an enemy of the

>con­ducting their affairs in the best interest of the com­pany's shareholders.
>To do this, they run programs and processes that attempt to hide themselves

When we buy a connected device running proprietary software, we often agree to Terms of Service at startup without even reading them. But in those terms, we've agreed to let the device's masters control and change the items we thought we owned outright, not just to keep it updated and running but often to brick it if we don't comply with "the rules". Imagine a pacemaker that stopped working if the person whose life depended on it didn't pay their bills or eat right. Sound crazy? It's already happening in many industries.


The focus on security of sensitive data is important, but perhaps it's masking the real danger: the Internet of Things is an incredibly lucrative market to companies that have very little regulation. Of course they're going to cheat. So maybe read those Terms next time? And join the EFF to learn more about privacy, safety, and what is being done to keep the cheaters at bay.


Alexa, play The Internet of S**t.
