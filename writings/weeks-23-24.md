# The End

There's probably a word in [The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/) for the feeling of emptiness and loss after one has achieved a major milestone.

Ah, there it is:

> etterath

> **n.** the feeling of emptiness after a long and arduous process is finally complete- having finished school, recovered from surgery, or gone home at the end of your wedding- which leaves you relieved that it's over but missing the stress that organized your life into a mission.

![the passage in Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows containing the word etterath](/sorrows.jpg)

I've been using the space that feeling creates to reflect on my past 6 months and solidify the lessons I have learnedâ€“ not only the technical lessons but the life lessons as well.

I am a significantly different person now than I was this spring, and I like the person I am becoming.

# The Beginning

I start my new role in a week. Every time I start to worry I don't know enough, I've been actively pushing back. I know the most important thing: How to learn. I am not afraid.

Instead of frantic study, I've begun now to set up my work environment. I was given a budget to make working from home easier, and so far I've purchased a better standing desk, a new monitor arm, and (this one will be new for me) a [Gymba Ergonomic Balance Board](https://www.imovr.com/gymba-ergonomic-balance-board.html). I've been experimenting with standing while working and found only one small issue: I don't retain reading as well when I am standing. I am not sure why, but this is why I wanted the option to sit when needed. I wonder if anyone else has observed this?
