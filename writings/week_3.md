# Week 3
I must admit that my time management skills leave something to be desired. I keep finding myself at the bottom of a rabbit hole, strapped for time to cover other topics. It's something to work on, but it is also a trait I like about myself. I enjoy collecting knowledge.

This week we built little portfolio pages. Mine is lovely and simple, leveraging bootstrap and a few nifty Js libraries I've been wanting to employ. In the end I could not fit them all in, but I will use Waypoints some day!

And yeah, this site should totally be quaking in its boots. I don't really need the framework this sits on, it's overkill. Except for this blogging engine. I need that. I love posting my entries by pushing markdown to main from Vim. I'm a special kind of geek.

## Mentors Rule

I fell into the dimension of Infrastructure as Code thanks to an impromptu talk from K about Terraform. Why is the world so vast? Why is time?

## Reading

I was out of town over the weekend and didn't even have good wifi, so I read instead. I finished Ready Player 2 and randomly picked up Redshirts as audio on the driving portion of my return trip. Still working through:

```js
const bookList = [
`Redshirts`,
`Domain Driven Design`,
`The Javascript Way`,
`Polysecure`,
`Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
`The Principles of Object-Oriented Javascript`,
`Crucial Conversations`,
`Attack Surface`,
`FLOW (re-read)`,
`Effective Python`
];
```
