# Welcome to life as a software engineer

It is the Sunday before my third week begins at Upstart. I had intentions of writing more about these early days, but I found myself either too busy or dealing with the side effects of being too busy. I'm still trying to figure out a balance.

There was no real "preparing for my first role", at least not in a way that mattered. I tried to put some systems in place in my household to make life easier (mostly successful). I set myself up for success by investing in an ergonomic work station, which is awesome! Still, most of the adjustment has to happen now that I know what my days look like. And I am adjusting.

BTW, I am a software engineer intern on a backend team, and everyone has been wonderfully welcoming and inclusive. I'm either extremely lucky or this is normal? Either way, I'm ecstatic.

# Onboarding and Orientation

I'm learning what those look like at my new company. For the most part it has been a pleasant time: learning the lay of the land, how teams work together, how to use tools to get help and figure stuff out. There have also been the lessons on company history and culture. This is my first real job so all of it feels alien. I have no way to know what is normal and what is particular to Upstart. I love experiencing it this way.

# Fun Moments

I had such a great time setting up my environment. I feel like I was extremely well prepared for this at Holberton. When I ran into snags I was able to solve them without much trouble at all, despite having very little experience with the languages I was setting up for. Turns out there is something to be said for being handed a learning framework and being turned loose to figure things out the hard way.

I was also well-prepared for the codebase, this time by my mentor [George Song](https://gsong.dev/) and his [template](https://github.com/gsong/express-react-project-starter) for my projects at Techtonica. Though naturally I'm dealing with a much more complicated application, I think I would have lost my shit if I didn't have some experience with a production-like setup via that template and the many hours I spent learning about and alongside it. Thanks, George. üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ &hearts;

# So, what's next?

It's time to get my hands dirty! I believe I'll learn about my first real work this week. I am scared and excited and confident that 1) I'll freak out at first and 2) I will be just fine.

I love my team and am very pleased with this first experience.
