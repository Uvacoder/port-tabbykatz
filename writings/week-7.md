# Week 7

![picture of the author](/happy_friday.png)

This week was open-an-etsy-shop rough. For me that means rage-considering quitting code and making a living off my knitting. Did you know I knit? I could never do it for money, I tend to knit in rashes of obsessive creation, but I'm rather skilled at it.

What made it so rough? 12 hour days, my kids returning and adjusting to school, screen fatigue and light-induced headaches... But there was also a lot of fun. I had many instances of what I will call the sheer delight of learning, which I believe is life's greatest drug.

## Work

I don't have a lot to show for myself this week. I build two different sample React 'apps', both of which are sparse lessons and nothing fancy.

- [Todo List to learn about callbacks in children](https://github.com/tabbykatz/SimpleToDo)
- ['SWeather to learn about state](https://github.com/tabbykatz/-Sweather)

I played around with PostgreSQL, I read a lot of documentation.

## Mentors Rule

I have been searching for a way to describe the learning-delight I mention, as well as the wonder of having a mentor who sees you as a worthy student. This will probably land a little too dramatically, but my favorite poet Rilke finds his words well:

<blockquote>We are all workmen: prentice, journeyman,
or master, building you â€” you towering nave.
And sometimes there will come to us a grave
wayfarer, who like radiance thrills
the souls of all our hundred artisans,
trembling as he shows us a new skill.

<blockquote>We climb upon the rocking scaffolding,
the hammers in our hands swing heavily,
until our foreheads feel the caressing wing
of a radiant hour that knows everything,
and hails from you as wind hails from the sea.

<blockquote>Then hammerstrokes sound, multitudinous,
and through the mountains echoes blast on blast.
Only at dusk we yield you up at last:
and slowly your shaping contours dawn on us.

<blockquote>God, you are vast. <br><br> &mdash;Rainer Maria Rilke, Poems from the Book of Hours</blockquote>

I think this belongs in this section: I am learning and enjoying a note-taking workspace tool called [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/). It has a learning curve (at least for me) so I am taking it slow, but it plays on my love of Markdown so!

## Reading

I've been reading documentation until my eyes will not stay open, but I am also making progress in Modern JavaScript for the Impatient, which has risen to the top as the best of the Js books I have read so far, so much so that I dropped The Javascript Way from my list. The list cannot handle any more books, and I would like to see it smaller still. Some of these are wondering if I am ever going to give them time.

```js
const bookList = [
  `grokking algorithms`,
  `Redshirts`,
  `Domain Driven Design`,
  `Polysecure`,
  `Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
  `Crucial Conversations`,
  `Attack Surface`,
  `FLOW (re-read)`,
  `A Mind for Numbers`,
  `So Good They Can't Ignore You`,
];
```
