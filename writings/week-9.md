# Week 9

I had plans to take better care of me this week but it was not to be. I had a hard week across the board. I wasn't always able to cut myself slack and know that next week is another chance. Grateful for that.

## Mentors Rule

An amazing week of new concepts in React and Node. I am moving forward.

I want to practice this, practice being present and sitting with problems beyond completion to develop this awareness.

## Reading

My active booklist is shrinking! Note to self: always make time for reading.

```js
const bookList = [
  `grokking algorithms`,
  `Domain Driven Design`,
  `Polysecure`,
  `Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
  `Crucial Conversations`,
  `Attack Surface`,
  `FLOW (re-read)`,
  `A Mind for Numbers`,
];
```
