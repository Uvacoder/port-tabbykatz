_Three weeks into the preparatory work for Techtonica, I'm looking forward to what's next!_


# Week -1

Having already finished the prework, I spent this week on a side project.

## Mentors Rule

My mentor continues to challenge me, in a good way. I went deep into authentication in flask this week, creating my first login/out page. Now I can truly relate to JoCo's "Code Monkey".

## Reading

I finished Mindset just in time to pick up Modern JavaScript for the Impatient.

# What's next?

Over the weekend I was challenged to not touch code, and I didn't. But I did have a few epiphanies about my Flask issues. If I find the time with Techtonica starting up, I want to see if they're useful.
