# Week 10

I am feeling the rewards of good habits this past week. Sleep, food, liquid. Routine is important. Taking breaksâ€“ really taking breaks! Morning walks.

It's Sunday as I write which is telling of the busy week and weekend I have had. Focus was hard to find but I didn't stop looking for it. I'm putting effort into being alright with what I see as a very slow learning pace. Being frustrated is not going to change that.

It's time for me to choose a final project for this apprenticeship Yeah... that's a problem. I don't have ideas like that, the idea is foreign to me. Mentor to the rescue; K is supposed to have a list for me soon.

Takeaways

- I hate time

## Reading

I did the bad thing and added a book to my list, but it was short fiction anyway.

```js
const bookList = [
  `In the Country of Last Things`,
  `grokking algorithms`,
  `Domain Driven Design`,
  `Polysecure`,
  `Modern JavaScript for the Impatient`,
  `Crucial Conversations`,
  `Attack Surface`,
  `FLOW (re-read)`,
  `A Mind for Numbers`,
];
```
