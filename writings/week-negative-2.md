_Two weeks into the preparatory work for Techtonica, I feel the good kind of exhausted._

How about a typing update? I finished all of the lessons at [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/). I am either missing something or they expect you to figure out punctuation and whatnot on your own. I've moved to TypeFu for speed and accuracy practice.

# Week -2
I did this week's work last week, but my mentor kept me busy. This week I learned everything I could about Docker in 2 days, from `chroot` to hands on experience pushing images to the hub. I also fixed my python environment with `pipenv`. What a lifesaver! Here's [a link](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you also have found yourself in venv hell.

## Mentors Rule

As I mentioned above, my mentor is keeping me busy. Having this relationship is the best possible thing. I am inspired and driven, but also humbled and kept in line. A perfect recipe for a happy tabbykat.

## I am still doing a lot of review

I tried out the codecademy PRO platform expecting to hate it but... I kind of like it. Grrr. I'm working there in Js as much as I can during my trial. I also earned my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/tabbykatz)! As I complete each review unit, I challenge myself to find one thing that I either didn't know or did not recall.

## Reading

I am almost done with Mindset by Carol Dweck which is good because I ordered Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans. I also picked out my first Js book purchase: Modern Javascript for the Impatient by Cay Horstmann.

# What's next?

I have already completed next week's work and the 'extra credit', so next week will be more Js review, typing practice, and whatever my mentor assigns.
