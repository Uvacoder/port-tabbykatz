# Javascript.info

I started reading through [this online (free) tutorial](https://javascript.info/) in the evening of 8/27/21. I love the text focus as for me, reading is the fastest way to get information into my brain. For some people it is video, but I can't stand the sound of speed-enhanced video and I read much faster than people speak.

I have read several Js books, so why am I doing this? Two reasons:

- Every book has new or differently presented information
- I glean more on review. Always.

## Things I've learned that I did not know before (or had forgotten) about Js

### 8/27 Basic Concepts:

Chapters read: [An Introduction](https://javascript.info/getting-started), [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps)

- Nested `switch` statements are a thing
- Why don't we talk more about `bigInt`?
- Unary operators convert to number like `Number(thing)`
- Operator precedence is behind `+=` assignment happening last
- Operators return a value ðŸ¤¯
- `++prefix` returns the new value and `postfix++` returns the old value. This makes sense but I had not thought much about it wrt Js.
