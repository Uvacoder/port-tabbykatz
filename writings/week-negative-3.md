_One week into the preparatory work for Techtonica, I feel energized and confident._

First, a word about typing. I am typing this more slowly than I would like and I will tell you why: I am finally abandoning the feral typing methods I cultivated over decades of hunting and pecking. I am learning to touch type. It is absolutely grueling, but I refuse to give up.

Some will tell you that engineers don't need to type quickly, that the bottleneck for code is never typing speed. My signature four-fingered style got the job done to the tune of 60wpm on good days. But my progress was completely maxxed out at that speed. Four fingers can only do so much.

 I have been exclusively using [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) to learn, and it is a slow project that tests my chill with every new letter. I have the settings locked down so that it forgives nothing, and it takes me hours to acheive a letter from the alphabet. I currently have 20 letters.

Theres more (likely boring stuff) to say, but the main takeaways are:

 - Forcing myself to slow down and practice a slower method is psychologically painful.

- I refuse to give up. I am currently reading Mindset by Carol Dweck and it just would not do for me to give up. I believe I can learn this, excel at it even.

# Week -3

Okay, that out of my system, I can talk about the first prework week and how I feel about the apprenticeship I am undertaking.

## I have a mentor!

I have a smart, funny, and dedicated volunteer mentor through Techtonica who I have already begun to work with. This is such a promising opportunity!

## I am doing a lot of review

Nothing wrong with that. I put the videos on my right monitor and practice typing on my left.

## One more time with feeling

I am reading articles and blogs about work balance, mindset, and the like that I have read before but am taking to heart for the first time. That feels good.

# What's next?

I'll be honest with you, I have already completed most of the prework for these 3 weeks. But I am staying busy. This weekend we meet as a cohort in a study group which should be fun. Next week I will finish off the last of the pre-work as well as the optional work. I expect to have 'all my letters' by Monday, which is when the real fun will begin wrt typing. Speed and precision, baby!
