I\nstarted my first round of <a href ="https://www.100daysofcode.com">#100DaysOfCode</a> and found my people. It\nis through this community that I fell in love with Javascript, for better or\nworse. It\'s rare to find a group online that lifts up more than it knocks down,\n\tbut this is one.\n\n---\n\n# Holberton Portfolio Project #\n\n<p>I\'m finishing my Foundations year at Holberton School. This means I am\nbuilding my capstone project, which I proposed as a portfolio/personal website\n(this one). I wanted to make something solid that I could build on for the next\nyear. I started this project in plain HTML/CSS/js, but quickly realized that if\nI want to build the stretch features I should use React & Next from the start. I have broken this thing more often than not, but that is how I learn best.</p>\n<p>As I write this, I have two pages left to build: /portfolio & /resume. While\nI originally envisioned my portfolio as a CSS-heavy page, I\'ve decided to keep\nit simple and list projects as I have these blog entries. This is the first\nmajor project I have completed on my own (without Holberton guidance) and I\nfeel power-drunk and frightened at the same time.</p>\n\n---\n\n# What will I write about?\n\n<p>I\'ve written blogs since they first came about, mostly about day-to-day\nlife, parenting, and homeschooling (when my kids were young).Today I write\ntechnical blogs for school and pleasure, extoll the virtues of good books or websites, and share the joys & trials of my life as a single mother of 5, fulltime student, and tech newb. </p>\n\n<p>I hope you\'ll enjoy reading here, and if you\'d like to respond or discuss you\ncan find me on <a href ="https://twitter.com/tabby__katz">Twitter</a>.</p>\n'}}]);
